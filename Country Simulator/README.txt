Program Concept and Design:
    To further my goals with programming and learning C# in general. I am going to create a console application that simulates the birth, growth, decline, and death of a country.
    This will happen all very quickly, but I want the program to create a log and record of what the Country was named, who were the key players, and how did it end.
    MVP - The simulator creates a population with names and proper indexes, and tne proceeds to kill off each simulated node. The simulator then creates a log of what occured.
